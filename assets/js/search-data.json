I have masters in Industrial Engineering and already worked on many different domains, from laundry powder design, thermodynamic modelling of heavy oils and also real estate machine learning systems. . I spent the last years working on a real estate metasearch startup and studying diverse machine learning topics, such as NLP for Information Retrieval and Computer Vision for Similarity Search. . During my career, besides data science skills, I developed solid software engineering skills and learned good development practices. Also, I had the opportunity to work also as technical leader, managing some projects and leading a team. . I’m half Brazilian and half Spanish, a casual runner and also a Jiu-Jitsu purple belt (well, before COVID-19). Besides that, I really love what I do and I also use my spare time to expand my knowledge reading papers and exploring new subjects, which I plan to share here in this blog. .

Attention is a “muscle” and as so, must be trained to become strong. | Your passion is also your doom. Obsession can be a good or bad thing. | Discovering what you don’t want is easier than trying to know exactly what you want. | The journey is more important than the end goal. However, don’t get lost in tools and side quests, have the final goal in mind always. | Deep focus (being in the zone) it is a huge source of happiness. | Happiness does not exist in vacuum, it is only real when shared with people that are important to you. | . Focus and Procrastination . Focus is about sacrifices. If you don’t deliberately select yours, life will choose those for you. However, it is not just simply saying no, you have to carefully analyse the options you have until you are convinced of your decision. You should explore our options enough to develop some conviction (Exploit and Explore), otherwise you’ll always wonder if the other path would be better for you. . “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, (…) and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. . I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” . Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar . A lack of focus can be seen also in procrastination. Some reasons are: . Waiting for Motivation. Action comes before motivation, not the opposite, but people wait for motivation to start something. We think we have enough time, and the motivation will come sometime. | False Expectations. We expect things to be easy. It will not be easy on the beginning for anyone and this just adds immense pressure in ourselves to be perfect from the start. This also leads to a fear of failure, and we avoid trying because it reduces the investment on something you think you will fail. | Misaligned Rewards. Not giving credit for something you achieved or will achieve, so you don’t think it is worth the effort. Also, obligation sometimes remove the pleasure and motivation for some people and you can procrastinate as a form of rebellion against others or this obligation. | Against your principles Unreasonable demands, against your core values, are root of procrastinations. Sometimes (small fraction) it is just lack of interest, so just try to get rid of the thing fast. | Lack of a solid plan. | Resources . https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html | https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html | https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/ | https://www.jamalx31.com/post/the-trap-of-ambitious-goals | Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy | Ugh fields | https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ty2tjPwv8uyPK9vrz/my-algorithm-for-beating-procrastination | .
