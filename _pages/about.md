I'm Victor! 

I'm a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer, but I accept the title of Heuristics Supervisor as well.

I have masters in Industrial Engineering and already worked on many different domains, from laundry powder design, thermodynamic modelling of heavy oils and also real estate machine learning systems.

I spent the last years working on a real estate metasearch startup and studying diverse machine learning topics, such as NLP for Information Retrieval and Computer Vision for Similarity Search.

During my career, besides data science skills, I developed solid software engineering skills and learned good development practices. 
Also, I had the opportunity to work also as technical leader, managing some projects and leading a team.

I'm half Brazilian and half Spanish, a casual runner and also a Jiu-Jitsu purple belt (well, before COVID-19).
Besides that, I really love what I do and I also use my spare time to expand my knowledge reading
papers and exploring new subjects, which I plan to share here in this blog.
