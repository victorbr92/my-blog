<p>In this part I share some of my principles and general quotes or blog posts that resonate with them.
This page is always on construction.</p>

<h2 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Attention is a “muscle” and as so, must be trained to become strong.</li>
  <li>Your passion is also your doom. Obsession can be a good or bad thing.</li>
  <li>Discovering what you don’t want is easier than trying to know exactly what you want.</li>
  <li>The journey is more important than the end goal. However, don’t get lost in tools and side quests, have the final goal in mind always.</li>
  <li>Deep focus (being in the zone) it is a huge source of happiness.</li>
  <li>Happiness does not exist in the vacuum, it is only real when shared with people that are important to you.</li>
  <li>When in doubt (do not understand something), go closer (start with small pieces).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="focus-and-procrastination">Focus and Procrastination</h2>

<p>Focus is about sacrifices. <br />
If you don’t deliberately select yours, life will choose those for you.
However, it is not just simply saying no, you have to carefully analyse the options you have until you are convinced of 
your decision.
You should explore our options enough to develop some conviction (Exploit and Explore), otherwise 
you’ll always wonder if the other path would be better for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.
From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. 
One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a 
brilliant professor, (…) and beyond and above these figs were many more figs 
I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, 
starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.</p>

  <p>I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, 
unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, 
they plopped to the ground at my feet.”</p>

  <p><strong>Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lack of focus can be seen also in procrastination. Some reasons are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Waiting for Motivation.</strong> Action comes before motivation, not the opposite, but people wait for motivation to start
something. We think we have enough time, and the motivation will come sometime.</li>
  <li><strong>False Expectations.</strong> We expect things to be easy. 
It will not be easy on the beginning for anyone and this just adds immense pressure in ourselves to be perfect from the start. 
This also leads to a fear of failure, and we avoid trying because it reduces the investment on something you think you will fail.</li>
  <li><strong>Misaligned Rewards.</strong> Not giving credit for something you achieved or will achieve, so you don’t think it is worth 
the effort. Also, obligation sometimes remove the pleasure and motivation for some people and you can procrastinate
as a form of rebellion against others or this obligation.</li>
  <li><strong>Against your principles</strong> Unreasonable demands, against your core values, are root of procrastinations. 
Sometimes (small fraction) it is just lack of interest, so just try to get rid of the thing fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of a solid plan.</strong></li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>Start by thinking about what you know and the question yourself before studying. <br />
Reevaluate your knowledge frequently, as understanding is not a binary “yes/no”. It has layers of depth. <br />
Confusion precedes learning, in case of it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clarify which part is confusing for you;</li>
  <li>Turn that into some concrete questions;</li>
  <li>Research on how to answer that question.</li>
</ul>

<p>To feel that you really know a subject you must be willing to play the devil’s advocate with yourself and be better
on it than the others. You must prove your knowledge and subject it to all the tests your mind can think of. <br />
You must be able to argue against yourself better than others can.</p>

<p>There are some essential virtues to be an effective learner:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Energy</strong>: To learn you should train your attention and be able to maintain high levels of energy and focus for long periods of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation</strong>: Inner drive for knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Passion</strong>: Motivation without passion is temporary.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Do not lie to yourself if you don’t understand something. It’s harder to lie when you have to write about it. Writing forces clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>Skepticism</strong>: Always test your assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility</strong>: Being unafraid to look stupid. Beginner mindset.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the stereotypical photographs of scientists studying rows of equations written on 
blackboards are instructors explaining discoveries already made. Real progress comes in 
the field writing notes, at the office amid a litter of doodle paper, in the corridor 
struggling to explain something to a friend, at lunchtime, eating alone, or in a garden 
while walking. To have a eureka moment requires hard work. And focus.</p>

  <p>(…) Daydream a lot. Make talking to yourself silently a relaxing pastime. 
Give lectures to yourself about important topics you need to understand. 
Talk with others of like mind. (…)
The ideal scientist thinks like a poet and only later works as a bookkeeper.</p>

  <p>(…) To make important discoveries anywhere in science, it is necessary not only to acquire a broad 
knowledge of the subject that interests you, but also the ability to spot blank spaces in that knowledge. 
Deep ignorance, when properly handled, is also a superb opportunity…To search for unasked questions, 
plus questions to put to already acquired but unsought answers, it is vital to give full play to the imagination. 
That is the way to create truly original science.</p>

  <p><strong>E.O. Wilson</strong>, Letters to a Young Scientist</p>
